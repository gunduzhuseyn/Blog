# Opinions On Sharing My Opinions

# To Share Or Not To Share

>papers.”

I came across this line going through my old notes, jotted on a piece of paper. To be honest, I do not remember whether 
I wrote these myself, or picked them up from somewhere else. I have been writing (poetry, short stories, and ramblings) since 
my childhood, probably since I was 11 or 12. Of course long before that, I started reading books, and I read a 
lot of them. For me, writing was another way to express myself, and have conversations with myself, usually on a 
piece of paper. Most of the time simple A4 pages generously hosted my ideas, and I had the control of sharing them 
with the people I wanted to. However, as I write these lines that are soon to be public, accessible by the internet, 
I can’t stop wondering about what I am doing. 

I am sure others have also faced this dilemma before: to share or not to share. I personally know of a friend of mine 
who destroys his writings after he is done with them, and a few others who rarely share what they have written. 
And I do realize that it is somewhat limiting to just talk about writing, since currently there are tons of other 
mediums to convey opinions through. Although I realize this problem is a common one, I want to approach it from a different 
angle. As it stands, I am not undecided because I am shy, and I do not want other people to see my ideas. 
On the contrary, I am a firm believer in exchanging ideas, in any form or shape. I am hesitating because I do not 
know whether you need to know about **my** ideas. 

I think so because I believe that we are living in an age of information pollution. We have countless sources that are 
shouting at us their opinions constantly, and I am not even talking about the fake news. I am talking about 
countless online blogs (yes I do realize that you are currently reading this on one of such blogs :) ), social media 
posts, viral videos, and loads of comments under each post. It is in human nature to state our opinions, it helps us 
find and build our identity. Yet, I believe it is this very nature that we are abusing as we are spamming the internet 
with our content. We feel the urge to shout that we are here, to comment our opinions, to argue and etc. However as we 
shout it out, it gets mixed with all the other noises, and becomes a part of an incoherent abyss of opinions. 

Additional to our natural urge to express ourselves, the social media platforms, and the other mediums alike, come up 
with designs that amplify our urge. One of the main reasons for this is obviously to generate more content on their platforms. 
However as a side effect not only we end up adding to the pollution, we also drain ourselves emotionally. Instead of taking 
physical actions, changing things around us, we simply change our profile pictures, or tweet about an issue. And more often 
than not,  we find ourselves disillusioned with the actual problems, or the solutions that affect others. I am not 
arguing that these posts or actions on social media are pointless, on the contrary, I know that a trending tweet might 
result in a delayed justice, or a positive change in some policy. Yet again, another problem arises with such traction of social 
media. Namely people jumping into the ‘trending trains’ without gathering enough information, or assessing the 
situation thoroughly.

So to be precise, my concern is that I might be just adding to this abyss of information, by writing posts such as this 
one. I do not claim to be knowledgeable enough about the topics I am writing, or I will be writing. Not enough for my 
words to be taken into consideration without a grain of salt, or enough to not make any mistakes, while turning my 
ideas into digital bits. Ideally, I would want to explore all the resources that exist, strip all my biases, and 
then start writing a blog post on any matter that includes my opinions. However in this ideal case, it would take me 
many lifetimes just to write a single post. 

At this point I would like to share a joke I came across on [Zizek’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek) 
book called [Violence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2638701-violence): 

> “The joke goes: Marx, Engels, and Lenin are asked whether they would prefer to have a wife or a mistress. As expected, 
> Marx, rather conservative in private matters, answers, “A wife!” while Engels, more of a bon vivant, opts for a 
> mistress. To everyone’s surprise, Lenin says, “I’d like to have both!” Why? Is there a hidden stripe of decadent 
> jouisseur behind his austere revolutionary image? No-he explains: “So that I can tell my wife that I am going to 
> my mistress and my mistress that I am going to my wife. . .” “And then, what do you do?” “I go to a solitary place 
> to learn, learn, and learn!” ”

By telling this joke, Zizek argues that sometimes it is best to hold back, learn as much as possible, 
and assess the situation rather than taking immediate actions towards events that pressures us into reacting in one 
way or another. In other words, if Lenin lived today, he would probably get a laptop and a kindle, and then read, 
and learn as much as he can, rather comment on a facebook post, or write a blog post about whether it is right to 
share one’s opinions on a blog post :).

I agree with Zizek, that it is sometimes better to not take an action, especially rather than an uneducated one. 
Yet at the same time, I give into my human urge to shout something out there, to let the universe, or whatever sentient 
beings live in it, that I am here. And I understand that by doing so, I might just very well be adding to the 
information pollution that I described above. So as a result, I am writing this post to hold as disclaimer. 
Feel free to call me out on my bs in any post you come across on this site. Feel free to correct me, and discuss things with me. 
(And here we are faced with the same dilemma again, which clearly I have no answer to. If you see something wrong, should
you call it out immediately, or settle back, and gather more information before jumping in? I leave it to you :) )
Even if you agree with me, 
remember that you should draw from a lot of different sources and just keep learning. Thanks for reading so far, and 
as a reward here is an [album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O1PrR9-PRI) that I kept listening to while writing 
this piece.
